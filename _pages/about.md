I am pursuing masters of science in Electrical and Computer Engineering department from [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/). I am incoming SoC Performance Architect Intern at Apple for Summer 2022. 

I am broadly interested in designing efficient and performant software systems. I am passionate about dealing with several aspects of the system stack including microarchitecture, kernel level optimizations to large scale distributed systems deployed in both real time and long running server scenarios. I have background in designing and programming scalable and performant software systems that are robust and resilient. I worked with [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) in the *Cloud Technology* division for the past year where I was involved in the delivery of software for a head micro-service deployed in multiple regions serving content to millions of users every minute.

I have an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) where I worked on several course and research projects under [Dr. Shouribrata Chatterjee](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~shouri/) involving behavioral and circuit level simulation, design and optimization using HDL and EDA tools. I also interned with Adobe at the *Big Data Lab* in the past where I worked on a novel research problem to identify and mitigate bias from the actions of actions of analysts as an aid in the decision making process using deep learning models.
